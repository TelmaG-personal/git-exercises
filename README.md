- .editorconfig
EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.

- .gitignore
A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. When deciding whether to ignore a path, Git normally checks gitignore patterns from multiple sources

- .dockerignore
When you run a build command, the build client looks for a file named .dockerignore in the root directory of the context. If this file exists, the files and directories that match patterns in the files are removed from the build context before it's sent to the builder.
